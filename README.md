# Practical Phase Field With Examples

## Introduction

Thank you for being interested in this small repository of code.  The purpose of this notebook and supporting files is to provide the reader and programmer with some foundational material to help learn and use phase field modeling.

There are many phase field models in the literature and it could be challenging for a student or researcher to implement those models especially if they are simultaneously learning a computer language and numerical techniques.  

I have selected three models and the Jupyter Notebook format to let the learner focus on the important aspects of phase field modeling and to provide an interactive, flexible form of instruction.

Please let me know if you find it useful.  If you have some new ideas for how it could be improved, I would be very interested in hearing them and, if it makes sense, to include them into future versions of this work.
